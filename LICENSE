The Software (and any modifications or derivatives thereto) and all Deliverables, are and shall remain the sole property of Couchbase and its licensors, and, except for the license rights granted herein, Couchbase and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software, including all intellectual property rights therein and thereto. The Software may include third party open source software components. If Licensee is the United States Government or any contractor thereof, all licenses granted hereunder are subject to the following: (a) for acquisition by or on behalf of civil agencies, as necessary to obtain protection as “commercial computer software” and related documentation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and as specified in Subpart 12.1212 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 C.F.R.12.1212, and its successors; and (b) for acquisition by or on behalf of the Department of Defense (DOD) and any agencies or units thereof, as necessary to obtain protection as “commercial computer software” and related documentation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and as specified in Subparts 227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3 of the DOD FAR Supplement, 48 C.F.R.227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3, and its successors.

Late payments will bear interest at the lesser of one and one half percent (1 ½%) per month or the maximum rate allowed by law.

6. Records Retention and Audit. Licensee shall maintain complete and accurate records to permit Couchbase to verify Licensee’s compliance with the Agreement (including the number of Licensed Nodes used by Licensee), and provide Couchbase with such records within ten (10) days of request. Upon at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, Couchbase may audit Licensee’s use of the Software to assess whether Licensee is in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Any such audit will be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee’s facilities and will not unreasonably interfere with Licensee’s business activities. Licensee will provide Couchbase with access to the relevant Licensee records and facilities. If an audit reveals that Licensee has underpaid fees to Couchbase, then Couchbase will invoice Licensee, and Licensee will promptly pay Couchbase, for such underpaid fees based on Couchbase's price list in effect at the time the audit is completed. If the underpaid fees exceed five percent (5%) of the Subscription Fee paid by Licensee for the Software, then Licensee will also pay Couchbase's reasonable costs of conducting the audit.

The receiving party of any Confidential Information of the other party agrees not to use such Confidential Information for any purpose except as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement.

The terms of this Confidentiality section shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the receiving party will, at the disclosing party’s option, promptly return or destroy (and provide written certification of such destruction) the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.
